                <h3>State of the Yield Curve</h3>

                <p>In mid-2019 there was a lot of discussion about the yield curve as a predictor of recession, but
                    there was no simple way to see whether it was inverted or not (aside from websites geared towards
                    finance experts).</p>
                <p>To satisfy my own curiosity about the daily status and historical trends of the yield curve, I
                    created a web application, built with django, which provided a simple visual representation of the
                    daily yield curves with the ability to also drill down into historical trends.</p>

                <p>In 2015 I decided to learn <a target="_blank" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, so I used that as an excuse to create the first version of my personal website (the one you're reading now).</p>
                <p>To get started, I found a theme that I wanted to use, but it didnâ€™t have everything I needed. I forked that theme and extended it to include several new elements for displaying Vertical and Horizontal content, as well as stylistic changes with regard to background color and text color options.</p>

                <h3>Hacking Seconds</h3>
                <p class='sub-header'>(2014)</p>
                <p>Watch enthusiasts are heavy forum users and they often share their collections in discussions. At the
                    time I started this project, sharing your collection meant uploading your photos to the forum every
                    time you wanted to share - it was a clunky and difficult process which offered a bad experience for
                    both the poster and the viewer. </p>
                <p>I created a <a target='_blank' href='https://www.djangoproject.com/'>django</a> application
                    (HackingSeconds.com) which provided watch enthusiasts a shareable public page for their watch
                    collection and a private view which allowed them to capture all the details of their collection (for
                    posterity and insurance purposes). With HackingSeconds, sharing a watch collection on a forum,
                    facebook, etc was as easy as pasting a link.</p>

                <h3>Hosted Tutorials</h3>
                <p class='sub-header'>(2013)</p>
                <p>After explaining Facebook to my mom one too many times, I decided to create a chrome extension that
                    allowed me to create and share tutorials for any website.</p>
                <p>With this extension, if my mom wanted to know how to post something on Facebook or send an email in
                    Gmail, I could just click on the area of the web-app in question and fill out a simple form. My mom
                    could then navigate to the page she had trouble with, see an available "tutorial" in the browser
                    extension, select it, and see my instructions as popovers with the text or YouTube video I provided
                    right inside facebook, gmail, etc. The extension also supported multi-step tutorials if the
                    explanation required several steps or features.</p>
                <p>This was my first web project, so the code is a mess and the back-end is a simple php script since it
                    was just for me - but you can check out the source <a target='_blank'
